# PhoneBook
![contact-us](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adc5ea58-09c7-4eb5-a74c-077842bd57a5)

### A very simple Phone Book console application using the most popular ORM, Entity Framework (EF)

## Requirements
- Application should record contacts with their phone numbers.
- Users should be able to add, delete, update, and read from a database using the console.
- Use Entity Framework; raw SQL isn't allowed.
- Code should contain a base `Contact` class with **at least** the following fields:
   - `Id` (INT)
   - `Name` (STRING)
   - `Email` (STRING)
   - `Phone Number` (STRING)
- Code should validate emails and phone numbers and let the user know what formats are expected.
- Code should be done using the **Code-First Approach**, which means EF will create the database schema.
- Code should use **SQL Server**, not SQLite.

- [Code sample using EF core on GitHub](https://github.com/entityframeworktutorial/EF6-Code-First-Demo)
- [What is Code-First approach?](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/what-is-code-first.aspx)
- [Setting up the connection string in the App.Config](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-strings?tabs=vs)
- [Async Guidance By David Fowler](https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md)

## Build Instructions
- Change the connection strings to your specified SQL Server instance and desired database name in the `App.Config` XML file.
- Use the command `Add-Migration <YOUR MIGRATION NAME>` in the PMC.
- Run `Update-Database` in PMC.
- Make sure to provide API keys for the Email Verifier and Phone Verifier in their respective `App.Config` files.
- You can get API keys for these services through these links:
   - [NumVerify](https://numverify.com/) - Sign up for free and get a free API key with a 100 requests per month allowance.
   - [EmailVerify](https://mailboxlayer.com/) - Sign up for free and get a free API key with a 100 requests per month allowance.

### Note: 
I left my API keys in the app configs so you can use them to test the app. However, please note that there are usage limits on these free keys.

## Features
- Used [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) Package to add colors and select menus with arrow keys.

## Lessons Learned
- I learned how to implement async methods correctly.
- I learned how to use the Code-First approach with EF Core, allowing the framework to create the database schema for me.
- I learned how to perform basic CRUD operations with EF.

## Future Improvement ðŸš€
- I think I still need to be more consistent with my code regarding how I define variables and structure external projects.
- I need to work on applying more design patterns efficiently, without sacrificing code readability.
- I aim to better decouple my code and apply a stronger Separation of Concerns (SoC) throughout my project.
